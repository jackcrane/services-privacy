### Information that we collect

We and our service providers collect a variety of information through the Services, including:

- **Account and profile information**. We collect information when you create an account or edit your profile, such as your name, username, password, email address, demographic category information you choose to provide, race history, and volunteer experience.
- **Event registration or volunteer information**. We collect information when you register or volunteer for a race or other event, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, country of residence, citizenship, age or date of birth, gender, race history and experience, club affiliation, occupation, and other demographic categories you choose to provide, emergency contacts, and self-reported disability status, proof of disability, or other health-related information that you provide directly to us as necessary for participation in a race or other event. Our third-party service providers may also collect your payment card information when you submit your registration.
- **Race activities and results**. We collect information when you participate in a race or other event that we organize. For example, we may collect information about your real-time location during a race (such as your progress along the course), your race times and splits, and your finishing results. We may share this information with the general public through our Services, as described in the section below titled “How We Share Information.”
- **Information you provide to us directly or through the Services**. We collect information that you provide to us directly or through the Services, such as when you post questions or comments, respond to surveys, rate the Apps, or communicate with us.
- **Information collected automatically**. When you use our Services, we or our third-party service providers may automatically receive and record certain information. For example, this may include your device’s IP address, user-agent string, information about your use of the Services during your current session and over time (including the pages you view and the files you download), the date and time of your visit, links you click, searches conducted, the website visited before navigating to the Services, your software and hardware attributes (including browser and operating system type and version, App version, device type, and device identifiers), and your general location inferred from IP address. To obtain such information, we or our third-party service providers may use the following technologies to recognize your device and collect information about your Services usage:
- **Server logs**. When you use the Services, we automatically receive and record certain information from your computer (or other device) and your browser. To obtain such information, we may use server logs or applications that recognize your device and gather information about its online activity.
- **Cookies**. We also use cookies on the Services. Cookies are small files that are stored on your device by your web browser. A cookie allows us to recognize whether you have visited before and may store user preferences and other information. If you are concerned about having cookies on your device, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set, allowing you to decide whether to accept it. You can also delete cookies from your device. However, if you choose to block or delete cookies, certain features of the Services may not operate correctly.
  - **Web beacons, tags, pixels, and similar technologies**. The Services or the emails that you receive from us may use an application known as a “web beacon” (also known as a “tag” or “pixel”) and similar technologies. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. For example, it may allow an email sender to determine whether a user has opened a particular email.
- **Mobile advertising IDs**. We may use mobile advertising identifiers (such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID) to collect information for analytics purposes, as described in the section below titled “Third-Party Analytics.”

We may combine information collected through the Services with information that we collect in other contexts, such as information from our email communications or phone calls with you, or data that we collect at races and events. We also may collect information about your race eligibility, race qualifying information (such as information related to your past participation in other races), and factors that may disqualify you from participating in a race. We will treat such combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Third-party links, websites, and apps

The Services may contain links to websites or mobile apps of other third parties, including social media sharing features that link to third-party websites. If you follow a link to any of these websites or apps, please note that these websites and apps (and any services that may be accessible through them) have their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites or apps or the information you share through such other websites or apps. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave the Services and to read the privacy policies applicable to such third-party websites and apps. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected in connection with the Services.

### Data security and retention

Adventure Crew/Paddlefest uses reasonable physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect your information against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification, or deletion. However, no security program is 100% secure, and thus we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

Adventure Crew/Paddlefest retains your information for as long as reasonably necessary for its legitimate business purposes, to provide the Services to you, to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law.

### Your rights and choices

Adventure Crew/Paddlefest provides you with choices to review, access, and update your information or to exercise your data protection rights, as follows:

Please note that if you unsubscribe from our promotional communications, you will still receive administrative messages from us.
- If you are a California resident under 18 years of age and a registered user of our Services, you may request that we remove content and information that you post on our Services. To obtain removal of such content and information, please send us an email to [info@ohioriverpaddlefest.org](info@ohioriverpaddlefest.org) with a short description of the content or information you would like to have removed. Please note that such a request does not necessarily ensure complete or comprehensive removal of content posted by you, since the content and information may remain in our or our service provider’s databases, may remain visible in a manner that does not identify you, or may have been re-posted by another user.
- You may have additional rights under applicable laws to request access to, correction of, deletion of, or restrictions on the processing of certain information. You also may have rights under applicable laws to opt out of or withdraw consent to further processing, request copies of your data, or lodge a complaint with a data protection authority in your jurisdiction. To make such a request and/or inquire about such rights, please send us an email at [info@ohioriverpaddlefest.org](info@ohioriverpaddlefest.org) with “Attn: Privacy/Legal” in the subject line. For your protection, we may only implement requests related to information that we have associated with the email address you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.

### Information for individuals outside the United States

The information that we collect through or in connection with our Services may be transferred to and processed in the United States for the purposes described above. Adventure Crew/Paddlefest also may subcontract the processing of your data to, or otherwise share your data with, third parties in the United States or other countries outside your country of residence. The data protection laws in these countries may be different from, and less stringent than, those in your country of residence. By visiting or using the Services, installing our Apps, clicking “I agree” or any other button indicating your acceptance of this Privacy Policy, or otherwise providing information to Adventure Crew, you explicitly consent to such transfer and processing.

We may implement standard contractual clauses, contractual arrangements, or other mechanisms, as appropriate, to safeguard your information during such cross-border transfers. We also may transfer information to the United States or another country as necessary for the performance of our agreements with you or to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.

If you are an EU resident, our legal basis for processing information will depend on the type of information at issue and the purpose for which it is collected and used. In many cases, we rely on your consent to process information, or we process information as necessary for the performance of our agreements with you. When processing special categories of data, such as ethnicity, we rely on your consent. We also may rely on our legitimate interests to process your information, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, except where such interests are overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

### Children's privacy

The Services are not intended for nor directed to individuals that are deemed to be children under applicable data protection or privacy laws. We request that such individuals do not provide information to us through any of the Services.

### Sensitive information

We generally ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive information (e.g., social security numbers, financial account information, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data, or sexual orientation) on or through the Services or otherwise to us, except for self-reported disability status, proof of disability, or other health-related information that you provide directly to us as necessary for participation in a race or other event. In some circumstances related to your account, you may have the option to provide us with information, such as your ethnicity, which we will only collect and process with your consent. None of this sensitive information will be shared with third parties, except in the aggregate and never in a form that is attributable to an individual, and you will always have the option to decline to share such sensitive information with us. 

### Changes to this privacy policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy periodically in the future. If we make any material changes, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on our Websites and in our Apps under “Settings,” with an effective date indicating when the revised Privacy Policy will take effect.
